         "AI for Demand Forecasting Author ASUG Staff Published August 16, 2024 Reading Time 5 minute read Bookmark This Article Link copied! At ALDO Group, a Canadian multinational premium retailer specializing in shoes and accessories, artificial intelligence and machine learning are equipping employees with the “superpowers” they need to succeed in delivering a superior customer experience. In a recent virtual event hosted by SAP, Matthieu Houle, Chief Information Officer at ALDO Group, detailed the company’s success in leveraging value-driven AI while harnessing SAP’s composable CX solutions to increase revenue and loyalty. For ALDO Group—which owns the brands ALDO, Call It Spring, GLOBO, and Sperry—overseeing the design and production of footwear and accessories across both brick-and-mortar and online operations is the work of 16,000 employees across the enterprise. To move that work forward, ALDO has developed a machine-learning model, “Delphine,” to ensure the company can avoid overstocking or understocking while optimizing its inventory management processes. Ultimately, this model will free employees to focus on more creative tasks, such as fashion trend predictions, while providing them with an analytical starting point for demand forecasting. Additionally, ALDO Group is helping to develop a generative AI model that will provide its shoppers with customized product recommendations based on particular celebrities and online influencers. If a shopper were to request, “I want shoes like David Beckham would wear,” for instance, the model would generate an image based on that input and recommend shoes that aligned with it. Last fall, ALDO Group partnered with McGill University in Montreal, hosting a “hackathon” during which students worked to develop retail solutions with generative AI capabilities. One team of students came up with the model, which ALDO is currently bringing into production. “I want to give my colleagues superpowers,” said Houle, referring to AI as a “key part” of ALDO"

TAKE SURVEY Generative AI Inside ALDO’s in-house generative AI and machine learning strategy By Kimeko McCoy • July 8, 2024 • Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Ivy Liu Amidst the artificial intelligence hype cycle, shoe and accessories retailer ALDO is working to lay its own internal AI foundations, expectant that the tools evolve from hopeful hypotheticals to mechanisms that deliver business results. Last October, the retailer held its first Retail Gen AI Hackathon in collaboration with McGill University in Montreal and Amazon Web Services. It led to a plan to revamp ALDO’s search functions and enhance product recommendations. The company is still focused on growing these areas, said Fatih Nayebi, vp of data and AI at ALDO. “Having machine learning and generative AI is something that people really are working on,” he said. “But all of them require to have a good foundation, from the data perspective, to be able to consolidate all of [the functionalities].” Currently, ALDO is using everything from machine learning to generative AI, including predictive AI, which uses machine learning to make predictions about future events. Like other companies, generative AI is in nascent stages,"

         "Partnership Retail Gen AI Hackathon Our Team Contact Us DataSphere Lab & ALDO Group Partnership: Shaping the Future of Retail with AI The DataSphere Lab (DSL) at McGill University’s Desautels Faculty of Management, in collaboration with the Bensadoun School of Retail Management (BSRM) and the Master of Management in Analytics, has been instrumental in bridging the gap between industry and academia, fostering innovation at its finest. ALDO Group / AI-sthetics project A prime example is our involvement in the ALDO Group / AI-sthetics project. This groundbreaking initiative is a collaboration between the DataSphere Lab, five multi-disciplinary McGill University undergraduate students, ALDO Group, and AWS (Amazon Web Services). Hackathon Launch BSRM launches the inaugural Retail Gen AI Hackathon, with ALDO Group’s sponsorship and tech infrastructure provided by the DataSphere Lab. Idea Selection ALDO Group’s C Suite reviews 40 innovative solutions and selects one idea, AI-sthetics project, for further development. Idea Development The DataSphere Lab facilitates the project’s implementation phase alongside the student team. Innovating with AI-sthetics The ALDO Group / AI-sthetics project, emerging out of BSRM’s Retail Gen AI Hackathon, will transform online fashion shopping. AI-sthetics concept, designed by a team of five interdisciplinary students, aims to engineer an advanced search engine that redefines the online shopping experience. Upon receiving a prompt, the system will generate an image matching the desired aesthetic, allowing users to accept or decline it; upon acceptance, they will be presented with ALDO products that resemble the items in the photo, creating a personalized shopping experience. The DataSphere Lab’s Role: Bridging Theory and Practice The DataSphere Lab stands at the forefront of this venture, offering a platform for the student-team to leverage their theoretical knowledge and combine it with practical application to a real-world problem. This experiential learning opportunity is invaluable in preparing them for their future"

         "AI for Demand Forecasting Author ASUG Staff Published August 16, 2024 Reading Time 5 minute read Bookmark This Article Link copied! At ALDO Group, a Canadian multinational premium retailer specializing in shoes and accessories, artificial intelligence and machine learning are equipping employees with the “superpowers” they need to succeed in delivering a superior customer experience. In a recent virtual event hosted by SAP, Matthieu Houle, Chief Information Officer at ALDO Group, detailed the company’s success in leveraging value-driven AI while harnessing SAP’s composable CX solutions to increase revenue and loyalty. For ALDO Group—which owns the brands ALDO, Call It Spring, GLOBO, and Sperry—overseeing the design and production of footwear and accessories across both brick-and-mortar and online operations is the work of 16,000 employees across the enterprise. To move that work forward, ALDO has developed a machine-learning model, “Delphine,” to ensure the company can avoid overstocking or understocking while optimizing its inventory management processes. Ultimately, this model will free employees to focus on more creative tasks, such as fashion trend predictions, while providing them with an analytical starting point for demand forecasting. Additionally, ALDO Group is helping to develop a generative AI model that will provide its shoppers with customized product recommendations based on particular celebrities and online influencers. If a shopper were to request, “I want shoes like David Beckham would wear,” for instance, the model would generate an image based on that input and recommend shoes that aligned with it. Last fall, ALDO Group partnered with McGill University in Montreal, hosting a “hackathon” during which students worked to develop retail solutions with generative AI capabilities. One team of students came up with the model, which ALDO is currently bringing into production. “I want to give my colleagues superpowers,” said Houle, referring to AI as a “key part” of ALDO",

ALDO Group / AI-sthetics project A prime example is our involvement in the ALDO Group / AI-sthetics project. This groundbreaking initiative is a collaboration between the DataSphere Lab, five multi-disciplinary McGill University undergraduate students, ALDO Group, and AWS (Amazon Web Services). Hackathon Launch BSRM launches the inaugural Retail Gen AI Hackathon, with ALDO Group’s sponsorship and tech infrastructure provided by the DataSphere Lab. Idea Selection ALDO Group’s C Suite reviews 40 innovative solutions and selects one idea, AI-sthetics project, for further development. Idea Development The DataSphere Lab facilitates the project’s implementation phase alongside the student team. Innovating with AI-sthetics The ALDO Group / AI-sthetics project, emerging out of BSRM’s Retail Gen AI Hackathon, will transform online fashion shopping. AI-sthetics concept, designed by a team of five interdisciplinary students, aims to engineer an advanced search engine that redefines the online shopping experience. Upon receiving a prompt, the system will generate an image matching the desired aesthetic, allowing users to accept or decline it; upon acceptance, they will be presented with ALDO products that resemble the items in the photo, creating a personalized shopping experience. The DataSphere Lab’s Role: Bridging Theory and Practice The DataSphere Lab stands at the forefront of this venture, offering a platform for the student-team to leverage their theoretical knowledge and combine it with practical application to a real-world problem. This experiential learning opportunity is invaluable in preparing them for their future",

In a recent virtual event hosted by SAP, Matthieu Houle, Chief Information Officer at ALDO Group, detailed the company’s success in leveraging value-driven AI while harnessing SAP’s composable CX solutions to increase revenue and loyalty. For ALDO Group—which owns the brands ALDO, Call It Spring, GLOBO, and Sperry—overseeing the design and production of footwear and accessories across both brick-and-mortar and online operations is the work of 16,000 employees across the enterprise. To move that work forward, ALDO has developed a machine-learning model, “Delphine,” to ensure the company can avoid overstocking or understocking while optimizing its inventory management processes. Ultimately, this model will free employees to focus on more creative tasks, such as fashion trend predictions, while providing them with an analytical starting point for demand forecasting. Additionally, ALDO Group is helping to develop a generative AI model that will provide its shoppers with customized product recommendations based on particular celebrities and online influencers. If a shopper were to request, “I want shoes like David Beckham would wear,” for instance, the model would generate an image based on that input and recommend shoes that aligned with it. Last fall, ALDO Group partnered with McGill University in Montreal, hosting a “hackathon” during which students worked to develop retail solutions with generative AI capabilities. One team of students came up with the model, which ALDO is currently bringing into production. “I want to give my colleagues superpowers,” said Houle, referring to AI as a “key part” of ALDO",

TAKE SURVEY Generative AI Inside ALDO’s in-house generative AI and machine learning strategy By Kimeko McCoy • July 8, 2024 • Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Ivy Liu Amidst the artificial intelligence hype cycle, shoe and accessories retailer ALDO is working to lay its own internal AI foundations, expectant that the tools evolve from hopeful hypotheticals to mechanisms that deliver business results. Last October, the retailer held its first Retail Gen AI Hackathon in collaboration with McGill University in Montreal and Amazon Web Services. It led to a plan to revamp ALDO’s search functions and enhance product recommendations. The company is still focused on growing these areas, said Fatih Nayebi, vp of data and AI at ALDO. “Having machine learning and generative AI is something that people really are working on,” he said. “But all of them require to have a good foundation, from the data perspective, to be able to consolidate all of [the functionalities].” Currently, ALDO is using everything from machine learning to generative AI, including predictive AI, which uses machine learning to make predictions about future events.

ALDO Group / AI-sthetics project A prime example is our involvement in the ALDO Group / AI-sthetics project. This groundbreaking initiative is a collaboration between the DataSphere Lab, five multi-disciplinary McGill University undergraduate students, ALDO Group, and AWS (Amazon Web Services). Hackathon Launch BSRM launches the inaugural Retail Gen AI Hackathon, with ALDO Group’s sponsorship and tech infrastructure provided by the DataSphere Lab. Idea Selection ALDO Group’s C Suite reviews 40 innovative solutions and selects one idea, AI-sthetics project, for further development. Idea Development The DataSphere Lab facilitates the project’s implementation phase alongside the student team. Innovating with AI-sthetics The ALDO Group / AI-sthetics project, emerging out of BSRM’s Retail Gen AI Hackathon, will transform online fashion shopping. AI-sthetics concept, designed by a team of five interdisciplinary students, aims to engineer an advanced search engine that redefines the online shopping experience. Upon receiving a prompt, the system will generate an image matching the desired aesthetic, allowing users to accept or decline it; upon acceptance, they will be presented with ALDO products that resemble the items in the photo, creating a personalized shopping experience. The DataSphere Lab’s Role: Bridging Theory and Practice The DataSphere Lab stands at the forefront of this venture, offering a platform for the student-team to leverage their theoretical knowledge and combine it with practical application to a real-world problem. This experiential learning opportunity is invaluable in preparing them for their future",

         "AI for Demand Forecasting Author ASUG Staff Published August 16, 2024 Reading Time 5 minute read Bookmark This Article Link copied! At ALDO Group, a Canadian multinational premium retailer specializing in shoes and accessories, artificial intelligence and machine learning are equipping employees with the “superpowers” they need to succeed in delivering a superior customer experience. In a recent virtual event hosted by SAP, Matthieu Houle, Chief Information Officer at ALDO Group, detailed the company’s success in leveraging value-driven AI while harnessing SAP’s composable CX solutions to increase revenue and loyalty. For ALDO Group—which owns the brands ALDO, Call It Spring, GLOBO, and Sperry—overseeing the design and production of footwear and accessories across both brick-and-mortar and online operations is the work of 16,000 employees across the enterprise. To move that work forward, ALDO has developed a machine-learning model, “Delphine,” to ensure the company can avoid overstocking or understocking while optimizing its inventory management processes. Ultimately, this model will free employees to focus on more creative tasks, such as fashion trend predictions, while providing them with an analytical starting point for demand forecasting. Additionally, ALDO Group is helping to develop a generative AI model that will provide its shoppers with customized product recommendations based on particular celebrities and online influencers. If a shopper were to request, “I want shoes like David Beckham would wear,” for instance, the model would generate an image based on that input and recommend shoes that aligned with it. Last fall, ALDO Group partnered with McGill University in Montreal, hosting a “hackathon” during which students worked to develop retail solutions with generative AI capabilities. One team of students came up with the model, which ALDO is currently bringing into production. “I want to give my colleagues superpowers,” said Houle, referring to AI as a “key part” of ALDO",

TAKE SURVEY Generative AI Inside ALDO’s in-house generative AI and machine learning strategy By Kimeko McCoy • July 8, 2024 • Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Ivy Liu Amidst the artificial intelligence hype cycle, shoe and accessories retailer ALDO is working to lay its own internal AI foundations, expectant that the tools evolve from hopeful hypotheticals to mechanisms that deliver business results. Last October, the retailer held its first Retail Gen AI Hackathon in collaboration with McGill University in Montreal and Amazon Web Services. It led to a plan to revamp ALDO’s search functions and enhance product recommendations. The company is still focused on growing these areas, said Fatih Nayebi, vp of data and AI at ALDO. “Having machine learning and generative AI is something that people really are working on,” he said. “But all of them require to have a good foundation, from the data perspective, to be able to consolidate all of [the functionalities].” Currently, ALDO is using everything from machine learning to generative AI, including predictive AI, which uses machine learning to make predictions about future events. Like other companies, generative AI is in nascent stages,",

Founded in 1972, the company now has more than 1,500 stores in over 100 countries. The brand offers shoppers style, variety, and comfort at the right price, which is what’s made it a beloved brand worldwide. ALDO Group’s founding vision was to create a different kind of fashion company built around respect, integrity, and a deep understanding of the customer. A connected e-commerce ecosystem underpinned by SAP solutions enables insights and experiences that are helping bring this vision to life.

ALDO Group / AI-sthetics project A prime example is our involvement in the ALDO Group / AI-sthetics project. This groundbreaking initiative is a collaboration between the DataSphere Lab, five multi-disciplinary McGill University undergraduate students, ALDO Group, and AWS (Amazon Web Services). Hackathon Launch BSRM launches the inaugural Retail Gen AI Hackathon, with ALDO Group’s sponsorship and tech infrastructure provided by the DataSphere Lab. Idea Selection ALDO Group’s C Suite reviews 40 innovative solutions and selects one idea, AI-sthetics project, for further development. Idea Development The DataSphere Lab facilitates the project’s implementation phase alongside the student team. Innovating with AI-sthetics The ALDO Group / AI-sthetics project, emerging out of BSRM’s Retail Gen AI Hackathon, will transform online fashion shopping. AI-sthetics concept, designed by a team of five interdisciplinary students, aims to engineer an advanced search engine that redefines the online shopping experience. Upon receiving a prompt, the system will generate an image matching the desired aesthetic, allowing users to accept or decline it; upon acceptance, they will be presented with ALDO products that resemble the items in the photo, creating a personalized shopping experience. The DataSphere Lab’s Role: Bridging Theory and Practice The DataSphere Lab stands at the forefront of this venture, offering a platform for the student-team to leverage their theoretical knowledge and combine it with practical application to a real-world problem. This experiential learning opportunity is invaluable in preparing them for their future",
