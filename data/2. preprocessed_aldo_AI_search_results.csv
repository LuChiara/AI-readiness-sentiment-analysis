At ALDO Group, a Canadian multinational premium retailer specializing in shoes and accessories, artificial intelligence and machine learning are equipping employees with the “superpowers” they need to succeed in delivering a superior customer experience. In a recent virtual event hosted by SAP, Matthieu Houle, Chief Information Officer at ALDO Group, detailed the company’s success in leveraging value-driven AI while harnessing SAP’s composable CX solutions to increase revenue and loyalty. For ALDO Group—which owns the brands ALDO, Call It Spring, GLOBO, and Sperry—overseeing the design and production of footwear and accessories across both brick-and-mortar and online operations is the work of 16,000 employees across the enterprise. To move that work forward, ALDO has developed a machine-learning model, “Delphine,” to ensure the company can avoid overstocking or understocking while optimizing its inventory management processes. Ultimately, this model will free employees to focus on more creative tasks, such as fashion trend predictions, while providing them with an analytical starting point for demand forecasting. Additionally, ALDO Group is helping to develop a generative AI model that will provide its shoppers with customized product recommendations based on particular celebrities and online influencers. If a shopper were to request, “I want shoes like David Beckham would wear,” for instance, the model would generate an image based on that input and recommend shoes that aligned with it. Last fall, ALDO Group partnered with McGill University in Montreal, hosting a “hackathon” during which students worked to develop retail solutions with generative AI capabilities. One team of students came up with the model, which ALDO is currently bringing into production. “I want to give my colleagues superpowers,” said Houle, referring to AI as a “key part” of ALDO",ai demand forecasting author asug staff published reading time minute read bookmark article link copied group canadian multinational premium retailer specializing shoes accessories artificial intelligence machine learning equipping employees superpowers need succeed delivering superior customer experience recent virtual event hosted sap houle chief information officer group detailed company success leveraging value driven ai harnessing sap composable cx solutions increase revenue loyalty group owns brands call spring globo sperry overseeing design production footwear accessories across brick mortar online operations work employees across enterprise move work forward developed machine learning model ensure company avoid overstocking understocking optimizing inventory management processes ultimately model free employees focus creative tasks fashion trend predictions providing analytical starting point demand forecasting additionally group helping develop generative ai model provide shoppers customized product recommendations based particular celebrities online influencers shopper request want shoes like beckham would wear instance model would generate image based input recommend shoes aligned last fall group partnered mcgill university montreal hosting hackathon students worked develop retail solutions generative ai capabilities one team students came model currently bringing production want give colleagues superpowers said houle referring ai key part,ai demand forecast author asug staff publish read time minut read bookmark articl link copi group canadian multin premium retail special shoe accessori artifici intellig machin learn equip employe superpow need succeed deliv superior custom experi recent virtual event host sap houl chief inform offic group detail compani success leverag valu driven ai har sap compos cx solut increas revenu loyalti group own brand call spring globo sperri overse design product footwear accessori across brick mortar onlin oper work employe across enterpris move work forward develop machin learn model ensur compani avoid overstock understock optim inventori manag process ultim model free employe focu creativ task fashion trend predict provid analyt start point demand forecast addit group help develop gener ai model provid shopper custom product recommend base particular celebr onlin influenc shopper request want shoe like beckham would wear instanc model would gener imag base input recommend shoe align last fall group partner mcgill univers montreal host hackathon student work develop retail solut gener ai capabl one team student came model current bring product want give colleagu superpow said houl refer ai key part
